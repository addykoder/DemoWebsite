            In this article, you will find out which programming languages will be popular in 2021, their differences,
            and where they can be applied.

        <p class="para">
            Without programming languages, the world as it stands would simply not exist. Imagine living without
            computers, digital technologies, and the Internet with Instagram and TikTok. It would seem very difficult,
            if not impossible.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            All languages have their purpose. Some are used for writing mobile applications, others for working with
            microcontrollers, and others for creating desktop programs or analytics. But, there are also cases when one
            problem can be solved using different languages.

            The History of Programming Language
        </h3>

        <p class="para">When programming languages did not exist, the first programmers wrote instructions for operating machines in numbers. They had to memorize a table of machine codes, not a few basic algorithms and principles of the language, as it is now. A little later, compilers appeared that made life easier for programmers. Compilers are programs that translated the words of programmers into machine code. Assembler became the first programming language.</p>
        <p class="para">Assembler is the lowest-level programming language focused on a specific type of processor, considering its features. The lowest does not mean bad. It means that the language operators are focused on specific processor instructions and are close to machine code. The emergence of the Assembler language greatly facilitated programmers’ lives, since now, instead of zeros and ones, they could write a program with instructions consisting of characters close to a common language. This language was a breakthrough in programming and was popular because it allowed writing small programs. The program written with Assembler started and ran slower than machine code, but writing the code was much easier. It is how the active development of programming languages began.</p>
        <p class="para">In the 1950s, the first algorithmic language was developed for the personal needs of IBM. It was named FORTRAN. By that time, there were already several languages that convert arithmetic expressions into machine code. Still, it was the creation of FORTRAN that was considered a transition to the paradigm of algorithmic languages. The new language made it possible to carry out calculations only by writing an algorithm using input/output operators and conditionals.</p>    
        <p class="para">After that, ALGOL, PL/I, and Simula-67 appeared. In the 1970s, the popular languages were Pascal and C.</p>
        <p class="para">New programming languages now appear with enviable regularity. Many companies develop their own languages, and Individual developers also experiment with this. At the moment, there are between 1,000 and 10,000 programming languages. This is because of the different meanings put into the concept of a programming language. Programming languages are classified according to various criteria: functionality, describing entities, way of implementation, and other parameters. It also matters how to classify varieties of one language: as separate languages or not.</p>

        <p class="para">
            Java is a versatile and sought-after option in the field of web development. Millions of programs have been written in this language, and new ones continue to be created, which guarantees its popularity for many decades to come. The language works on any platform, allowing you to write various applications and graphic widgets at the expense of its capabilities, and feels great in all known operating systems. It is used to develop server, web, client, mobile applications, games, and scientific research. It also allows you to understand the basic principles of programming through well-organized work with memory and peripherals.

        <h3 class="heading">What Professions Require Knowledge of Programming Languages?</h3>
        <p class="para">The "programmer" profession is very general and gives a superficial idea of what exactly a person is doing. There is a wide variety of fields and specialists within the IT field.</p>
        <p class="para">According to Yana Trihub, Founder, CEO of GetCoverLetter, “There are many areas in the IT industry where a programming language can be useful to you; development of sites, programs, and applications, web design, etc. Or maybe you are changing your profession and need new skills and knowledge. Along with knowledge of languages comes a positive effect on a person’s salary level."</p>
        <p class="para">Now, let's take a closer look at what specific cases we need programming languages.</p>
        <p class="para">It takes two web developers to create a feature-rich, well-functioning small site. The first developer makes sure that the part of the site that the user sees works correctly: buttons are pressed, prompts pop up, the scroll bar works. They are known as a frontend developer. The specialist is responsible for ensuring that the site interface works correctly and looks the way the designer intended. The second person, the backend developer, is responsible for ensuring that your messages are sent to the exact address, the viewing history of your videos is saved, and you see how many likes your subscribers have put on the new avatar. For all these functions to be performed, you need to know how the Internet works and how to work with the database.</p>
        <p class="para">Some specialists work on creating both parts of the site, and such a programmer has a full-stack developer profile.</p>
        <p class="para">IOS developers and Android developers create mobile versions of websites or applications. Depending on which operating system you are working with, you will have such a direction.</p>
        <p class="para">Data Scientist is responsible for special algorithms, so-called recommender systems. A specialist knows how to write a neural network and what algorithm to use to calculate the most suitable product for a recommendation or analyze the target audience.</p>
        <p class="para">After you have created the website or mobile application and added a recommendation algorithm to it, you need to check how it all works. A qualified tester checks the application. Their tasks include writing special programs (tests) that will automatically check the operation of the application. Sometimes, a tester can do it manually, depending on the specialist’s qualifications and work area.</p>
        <p class="para">The IT field is very diverse, and it requires completely different specialists with different skills. And before choosing a direction in programming, you should think about what interests you the most.</p>
